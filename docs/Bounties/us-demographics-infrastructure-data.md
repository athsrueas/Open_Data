## Problem
Critical planning data is fragmented across states and counties, often locked in PDFs or scans.

## Bounty direction
Normalize/centralize public construction, demographic, and infrastructure datasets.

## Targeted start
Electricity/water/demographics data in specific states.

## Example scopes
- County-level demographic + school construction data
- Water and electricity infrastructure datasets
- Population growth vs infrastructure investment

## Notes
- Choose a target state with accessible utility and demographic datasets.
- Define a canonical schema for infrastructure assets (type, capacity, age, owner).
- Plan for linking demographic data to infrastructure coverage areas.
- Document data licensing and update cadence by source.

## Starting point suggestions
- Select two states and prioritize electricity + water infrastructure datasets.
- Build a small, normalized sample (3–5 counties) with demographics attached.
- Create a data dictionary and identify fields that need normalization.
- Publish a checklist for expanding to additional states.
