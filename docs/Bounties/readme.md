# Bounties

This folder contains **one Markdown (`.md`) file per bounty**.

Each file should document a single bounty, including:
- The problem or goal
- Scope and requirements
- Deliverables
- Evaluation criteria
- Reward details (if applicable)

Use clear filenames so each bounty is easy to identify and reference.
