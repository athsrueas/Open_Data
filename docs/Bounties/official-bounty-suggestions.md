# Official bounty suggestions

| ID | Bounty | Problem | Bounty direction | Targeted start | Example scopes | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P1 | Policy Claims → Outcomes Maps | Political claims are rarely tied to outcomes. Fact-checking is shallow and narrative-driven. | Map policy claims to evidence and measured outcomes. | Comparing Trump vs Biden policies and outcomes. | Minimum wage effects; Education spending vs results; Healthcare reform outcomes; Energy policy impacts. | Adam Ficher |
| P2 | Education System ROI Analysis | Massive student debt with unclear outcomes. Universities dominating conversation while trade worker shortages grow. No clear data comparing educational pathways to career outcomes. | Map education investments to career outcomes, comparing university vs trade school paths. | Pilot with specific trades facing worker shortages (electricians, plumbers, pilots) vs related university programs. | Trade certification costs vs starting salaries; University debt loads vs 10-year earning trajectories; Regional demand for trades vs university graduates; Infrastructure job growth vs education pipeline capacity. | Adam Ficher |
| P3 | Public Data Accessibility Project | Coworkers frustrated by lack of data organization across jurisdictions. Public data exists but requires extensive scraping and conversion from PDFs to usable formats. | Create public APIs and standardized formats for commonly needed municipal data sets. | Focus on data types Thomas's team uses most: demographics, utilities, infrastructure planning. | Property tax assessment standardization across counties; Building permit process data and timelines; Zoning regulation databases by municipality; Public school enrollment and capacity data. | Adam Ficher |
| P4 | Infrastructure Investment → Outcomes Tracking | Towns make infrastructure investments without clear frameworks for measuring success or comparing approaches. | Track infrastructure spending to measurable community outcomes. | School construction projects - cost, timeline, community impact metrics. | School building costs vs student performance improvements; Infrastructure spending vs population retention/growth; Public transit investments vs economic development; Utility upgrades vs business attraction/retention. | Adam Ficher |
| M1 | US Demographics & Infrastructure Data | Critical planning data is fragmented across states and counties, often locked in PDFs or scans. | Normalize/centralize public construction, demographic, and infrastructure datasets. | Electricity/water/demographics data in specific states. | County-level demographic + school construction data; Water and electricity infrastructure datasets; Population growth vs infrastructure investment. | Adam Ficher |
| M3 | Global Energy & Sustainability Data | Climate and energy data is scattered across agencies and massive reports. | Create structured, country-level energy and climate datasets. | Start with all the latest GIEC reports. | — | Adam Ficher |
