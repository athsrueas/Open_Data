# Policy Claims → Outcomes Maps

**Source:** Adam Ficher

## Problem
Political claims are rarely tied to outcomes. Fact-checking is shallow and narrative-driven.

## Bounty direction
Map policy claims to evidence and measured outcomes.

## Targeted start
Comparing Trump vs Biden policies and outcomes.

## Example scopes
- Minimum wage effects
- Education spending vs results
- Healthcare reform outcomes
- Energy policy impacts

## Notes
- Start with a small number of policy domains so outcomes can be measured consistently.
- Define the outcome metrics and time windows before selecting claims to avoid cherry-picking.
- Track sources for both claims and outcomes with an evidence ledger (claim text, date, source URL, outcome dataset).
- Normalize geography and time ranges to keep comparisons defensible across administrations.

## Starting point suggestions
- Pick one policy area (e.g., minimum wage) and a single outcome metric (employment or wage growth).
- Assemble a claims list from official statements or speeches with timestamps.
- Map outcomes using a single authoritative dataset (e.g., BLS or BEA) and document any lag assumptions.
- Produce a simple claims-to-outcomes matrix with links to evidence.
