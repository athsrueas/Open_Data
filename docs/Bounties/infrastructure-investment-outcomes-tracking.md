# Infrastructure Investment → Outcomes Tracking

**Source:** Adam Ficher

## Problem
Towns make infrastructure investments without clear frameworks for measuring success or comparing approaches.

## Bounty direction
Track infrastructure spending to measurable community outcomes.

## Targeted start
School construction projects - cost, timeline, community impact metrics.

## Example scopes
- School building costs vs student performance improvements
- Infrastructure spending vs population retention/growth
- Public transit investments vs economic development
- Utility upgrades vs business attraction/retention

## Notes
- Establish a baseline timeframe for outcomes (e.g., 3–5 years post-project).
- Define comparable outcome metrics by project type (schools, transit, utilities).
- Align capital project data with local economic and demographic datasets.
- These align with Thomas's expertise in construction project management, education background, data warehousing skills, and passion for public good through better data organization.

## Starting point suggestions
- Start with a small set of school construction projects in one region.
- Gather cost, schedule, and change-order data alongside school performance metrics.
- Produce a dashboard-ready dataset that links project details to outcomes.
- Identify missing metrics to guide future data collection.
