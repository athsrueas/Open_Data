## Problem
Climate and energy data is scattered across agencies and massive reports.

## Bounty direction
Create structured, country-level energy and climate datasets.

## Targeted start
Start with all the latest GIEC reports.

## Example scopes
- Emissions and energy mix trends by country
- Climate finance commitments vs disbursements
- Renewable deployment rates vs policy targets
- Country-level climate risk indicators

## Notes
- Prioritize authoritative sources (IPCC/GIEC, IEA, UNFCCC) with clear release versions.
- Harmonize country identifiers and time ranges across datasets.
- Capture provenance for reported figures and highlight uncertainty ranges.
- Decide on a minimal indicator list to reduce scope creep.

## Starting point suggestions
- Extract a subset of IPCC/GIEC AR6 indicators into a structured table.
- Combine with one energy dataset (e.g., IEA or World Bank) for cross-validation.
- Publish a schema with units, source references, and update cadence.
- Identify missing indicators to guide the next data ingestion sprint.
