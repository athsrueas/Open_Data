# Education System ROI Analysis

**Source:** Adam Ficher

## Problem
Massive student debt with unclear outcomes. Universities dominating conversation while trade worker shortages grow. No clear data comparing educational pathways to career outcomes.

## Bounty direction
Map education investments to career outcomes, comparing university vs trade school paths.

## Targeted start
Pilot with specific trades facing worker shortages (electricians, plumbers, pilots) vs related university programs.

## Example scopes
- Trade certification costs vs starting salaries
- University debt loads vs 10-year earning trajectories
- Regional demand for trades vs university graduates
- Infrastructure job growth vs education pipeline capacity

## Notes
- Align pathways by geography and cohort year so outcomes are comparable.
- Define ROI consistently (e.g., debt + direct costs vs earnings over 10 years).
- Capture credential length, completion rates, and apprenticeship availability as contextual variables.
- Document licensing requirements and wage reporting sources for each trade.

## Starting point suggestions
- Choose one region (state or metro) with strong labor market reporting.
- Collect trade program costs and completion stats from public community colleges or trade associations.
- Pull university outcomes from College Scorecard and compare with BLS wage data for the selected trades.
- Draft a simple ROI comparison table and list data gaps for follow-up.
